<h2>Scenario</h2>

Baba’s is an independently-owned Gullah restaurant in South Carolina. They have recently launched a new line of proprietary spice blends. Currently, they only sell these products in their restaurant. However, to help achieve the company’s business goal to raise annual sales by 10% over the previous year, they plan to also sell the product line on the company’s website. You are responsible for running social media and email campaigns to to increase website traffic and conversions, as measured by the CTR and CVR.

<h2>Setting Up Our Performance Goals</h2>

<p>
Step 1: To setup our Q4 perfromance goals, I’ll review Baba’s Restaurant’s Q4 business goal, the related marketing objectives, and the KPIs I’ll track to measure our progress.

Step 2: Calculate Baba’s Restaurant’s Q3 conversion rates and click-through rates for e-mail and social media to see how they compare to Industry standards. </p>

<br />

<p>
Conversion Rate Percentage = <br/>
Emails: 90 Conversions / 1,200 Total Clicks x 100 = 7.5% <br/>
Social Media: 30 Conversions / 900 Clicks x 100 = 3.33%

</p>
<br />

<p>
Click-through Rate Percentage = <br/>
Emails: 1,200 clicks / 80,000 Impressions x 100 = 1.5% Click-through Rate Percentage <br/>
Social Media: 900 Clicks / 90,000 Impressions x 100 = 1% Click-through Rate Percentage

<br />

<p>
Taking the industry averages into account, the performance goals for Q4 aim to outperform the industry averages and attainably improve upon Q3 company performance data for each KPI. <br/>

<b>The Q4 performance goals</b> does not need to add up to the desired percentage point increase across all channels. Because I set goals for two (email and social media) that I am responsible for out of possibly many other channels, the below performance goals can contribute toward a combined marketing goal without necessarily satisfying it. Other channels would presumably contribute and make up the difference to meet the overall marketing goal.
